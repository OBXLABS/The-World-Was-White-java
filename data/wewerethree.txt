the world was white;
we were three,

speeding through the vast winter's skin
pulled taught and bright
over the valley's standing trees,

fit tight
into the cab of ol' Blue,
we floated in a warm bubble, seamed inside the cold and wet.
you said to Chris and me

that you had been thinking of having a child.
we, gentlemen that we are, immediately
offered our seed

even if clinically delivered.
we proposed mixing his sperm, my sperm in the same vial
so that neither would ever feel the need

to be selfish with the child.
you laughed, and asked us
why we do such a deed.

we laughed back,
unsure, but convinced at least
that such a progeny would lead

an interesting life, if only because of its mother,
a lucuna in life's studied framework,
set adrift to be

a continuing moment of chaotic touch
in lives too ruled
by expectations impossible to redeem.

what would she name him?
or her, she murmured,
or her, we happily agreed.

what would it be?
some word from the outside,
some word beyond simple needs,

beyond what we've come
to so easily expect
from our small-town, dying breed.

on this, on this indeed
we all agreed; 
unable to forget,
but still willing to bleed.

the world was white.
we were three.
