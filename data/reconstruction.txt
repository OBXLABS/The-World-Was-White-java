peel back these photos, these stillswallow in the sadness of nostalgia’s quiet thrill.these people are not   were they ever?we thought ourselves so sundrenched, immortal and clever.caught half-undressed, smiling forever,her name - that one -  I’ll never again remember.the past doesn’t grow old, it simply disappears,while these flatland photographs lead entirely seperate careers.the colors of memory leave their twisting trace;look here - dad is on fire;his blood, left orphan, is in search of a face.
